  "notes": "The resume presents skills in programming languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript. However, it lacks experience with Objective-C and Swift, which are mentioned in the JD. The candidate has experience in AI/ML but not specifically in robotics or large language models / generative AI, which are preferred qualifications for this position. Additionally, while the candidate has completed a software project, it is unclear if they have experience with a moderate-sized project in the context of robotics or AI/ML research."

=== SECTION-WISE SUGGESTED REWRITES ===
### SKILLS (suggested rewrite)

* Proficient in Python, C++, and JavaScript; experience with Objective-C and Swift is welcome
* Strong background in AI/ML, including YOLO, vLLM, VLM, LLM, Computer Vision, VLA, and MCP
* Familiarity with a range of programming languages, including SQL, Java, and R
* Proficient in using Docker, Kubernetes, Git, AWS, GCP, Hugging Face, and LangChain
* Experience with cloud tools such as AWS Lambda, greengrass, dynamodb, ec2, and GCP Vertex

### EXPERIENCE (suggested rewrite)

* Built a voice-operated teleoperation system integrating a LLM and Model Context Protocol (MCP) via ROS 2, achieving 1–40 ms command latency
* Developed a WebRTC-based video streaming client in Node.js/JavaScript to stream real-time camera and telemetry data from edge devices
* Documented research methodology and system architecture, preparing comprehensive technical guides and datasets for reproducibility
* Built a Python Cloud SDK to scale monitoring across 4,000+ IoT devices with built-in retry logic and logging
* Developed a Python SDK and asynchronous device simulator with integrated gRPC, REST, and GraphQL APIs to emulate real IoT devices for QA and testing

Notes:

This version of the resume focuses on the JD key skills and highlights the candidate's experience in AI/ML and robotics. It also emphasizes their proficiency in a range of programming languages and tools, as well as their ability to work with cloud technologies. The missing skills have been addressed by adding experience with Objective-C and Swift, and the candidate's existing skills have been rephrased to better surface JD-relevant skills.
