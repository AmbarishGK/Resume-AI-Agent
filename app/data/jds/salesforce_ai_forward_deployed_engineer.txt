About the Role

We are looking for the best and brightest college graduates to join our Agentforce Forward Deployed Engineer organization. This hybrid technologist and strategic partner role will personally drive transformative AI solutions by designing, developing, and directly implementing bespoke solutions leveraging our Agentforce platform and other cutting-edge technologies. The role demands technical mastery, problem-solving prowess, and a relentless focus on delivering tangible value in dynamic, real-world environments, from initial concept to successful deployment and ongoing optimization. As an Agentforce Forward Deployed Engineer, you'll be at the forefront of bringing cutting-edge AI solutions to our clients, rolling up your sleeves to make it happen. This isn't just about coding; it's about deeply understanding our customers' most complex problems and crafting, building, and delivering innovative, impactful solutions that leverage our Agentforce platform and beyond.

Your Impact

Drive Tangible Outcomes through Hands-On Implementation: Be responsible for the end-to-end technical delivery of AI solutions, personally writing code, configuring systems, and troubleshooting issues to ensure successful deployment and measurable business impact.

Remove Technical Blockers: Proactively identify and directly resolve complex technical challenges during all phases of solution delivery, from data integration to model deployment and agent orchestration. You'll be the go-to expert for unblocking progress.

Build Transformative AI Solutions: Design, develop, and personally implement high-quality, scalable production systems. A significant part of this will involve leveraging AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent agents and automate workflows, all built on top of the Salesforce platform.

Data Configuration & Integration: Take direct ownership of data from end-to-end. You'll design robust data models, hands-on build efficient processing pipelines, and establish seamless integration strategies to ingest, transform, and analyze complex datasets. Your work will ensure data is always ready and optimized for our AI applications.

Drive Agentforce Innovation: Become an expert in our innovative Agentforce platform. You'll directly push its capabilities to the limit, developing bespoke intelligent agents, automating intricate business processes, and crafting intuitive user experiences that deliver tangible value.

Become a Trusted Partner: Embed yourself with client teams to truly grasp their operational challenges and strategic goals. You'll translate these nuanced needs into clear, actionable technical requirements, building strong relationships as their primary technical advisor.

Conduct Deep-Dive Technical Debugging: Perform detailed analysis and debugging of complex system interactions, data flows, and AI model behaviors to optimize performance and ensure reliability.

Prototype and Iterate Rapidly: Quickly develop proofs-of-concept and minimum viable products, coding alongside client teams to demonstrate capabilities and gather feedback for iterative refinement.

Implement Best Practices: Directly apply engineering best practices for code quality, scalability, security, and maintainability across all deployed solutions.
