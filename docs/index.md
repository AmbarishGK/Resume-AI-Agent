# Resume-AI-Agent

This repo is a student-style project that combines:

- job scraping + job description fetching
- a local SQLite DB for JDs/resumes
- a transparent baseline matcher (score + gaps)
- an interactive Streamlit RAG "copilot" for analysis and rewrites

Start here:

- `Project Report` (high-level summary + what to demo)
- `Getting Started` (clone + install)
- `Streamlit Copilot (RAG)` (recommended interactive demo)
