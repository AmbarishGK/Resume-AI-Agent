# Resume-AI-Agent

This project is a small end-to-end pipeline for:

- scraping job postings from company career pages
- fetching the full job descriptions (JDs)
- ingesting resumes + JDs into a local SQLite DB
- scoring a resume <-> JD pair and reporting gaps

Start here:

- `Getting Started` for clone + install
- `Usage` for the pipeline and CLI commands
